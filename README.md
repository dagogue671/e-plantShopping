In this final project, you will create a shopping cart application for an online plant shop which offers a variety of house plants.

The Paradise Nursery shopping cart features will include:

- A Landing page with a button linking to the product listing page
- A navigation bar with links to the landing, product listing, and shopping cart pages
- A card for each plant that showcases the different plants along with their images, name, description, cost and an Add to cart button.
- A minimum of two sections describing the plants in that section. For example, "Aromatic Plants" and "Medicinal Plants".

- Redux Integration: Integrate Redux within an application using Redux concepts like actions, reducers, and the store.
- Rendering Dynamic Data: Dynamically render data fetched from an array of objects into the UI. You will map over arrays to generate lists of components.
- Handling Events and Conditional Rendering: Handle user events such as button selection and trigger corresponding actions.
